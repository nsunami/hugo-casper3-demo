I don't go to Church every Sunday. I don't pray the rosary every day. And I can't remember the last time I had my confession with the presence of a priest.

I, by all means, am not a perfect Catholic but I believe in God wholeheartedly and faithfully.

When I heard that I may have lymphoma, I was terrified but I didn't ask the question most people do when they're hit by a catastrophic news, I didn't ask my God, "Why me?".

I trust that everything happens for a reason, that God won't give us challenges we cannot conquer, and that He is always with us even if sometimes we may not feel so. Right now I don't know the plans God has for me but I trust that He will guide me all the way.

As discussed in my post ([Below zero](http://www.jazellemaira.com/below-zero/)), the possibility of me becoming sterile due to chemotherapy is 30-40%. After lots of thinking, my husband and I decided to undergo fertility preservation treatment. We decided to freeze our embryo. It wasn't an easy decision. We had to consider financial resource, physical and emotional preparedness but most importantly we had to make sure that no matter what happens, the life we are consenting to make through science won't be treated poorly.

We reached out to our priest friend about our decision. We've always felt that God is always by our side but of course, we had some second thoughts because what we were about to do is morally ambiguous. Hearing these words from our priest friend was such an assurance: "you are adults, I know you've discerned about this for quite some time and that you are aware of the responsibility that comes with it. The Church's stand is that life begins at conception, I just hope no life would be discarded. If this makes you feel like it is bringing you closer to God and making you guys better people, I will be with you on this journey."

In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is an intense process. Fourteen days of belly shots, injections in the morning and at night. There are nights you have to inject two types of medicine and there's a limited window of time for the shots. Precision is necessary. It is a commitment, nonetheless! To top that, blood work and an ultrasound of my ovaries and uterus were taken every other day to make sure the follicles are responding well to medication.

# I'm glad I wasn't alone.

The ultrasounds showed that my follicles were responding well to the medication. They were growing in size every day. However, on our tenth day, the nurse practitioner saw that there's a huge build-up of fluid in my pelvis, a condition they see typically after the retrieval of the eggs. Before we left the exam room, the nurse practitioner already explained that because of the fluid in my pelvis the doctors might decide to stop the IVF process for my safety.

One of the doctors of the fertility clinic called me in the afternoon and said she talked to my oncologist. The oncologist said that the build-up of fluid is caused by my lymphoma. Apparently, my lymphatic system is not able to drain the fluid out. The oncologist wasn't too worried about it being a problem. He said the fluid usually goes away after the first chemotherapy but it really concerned the fertility doctors.

All of the doctors weighed in on my case:

A 26-year-old female who has chronic anemia, heightened risk of infection, weakened immune system, and fluid build-up in the pelvis undergoing surgery for egg retrieval.

The doctors decided it was too much of a risk to take. They expressed that they really wanted the IVF to work for me but my life is still their priority. The fertility team donated to us all the really expensive medicines I needed. They took care of me in the most professional way so I know they really were rooting for our success. I know they did their best. We all did. It just wasn't for us.

We reached day 10 out of the 14 days. It was devastating. I mourned a loss that was never mine but I continue to trust. I didn't ask my God why because I know he has his plans. He is and always will be by our side.
