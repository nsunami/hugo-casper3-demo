Two months ago, our family, my father-in-law and two beautiful nieces visited us. It was a short 8-days-stay but a very meaningful one. I was really happy when I heard that they wanted to visit but also, I was anxious. My husband's family has been so wonderful to me, I wanted their stay to be nothing but incredible.

When I went to Japan almost 3 years ago, I didn't meet my husband's nieces. I've Skyped with them on several occasions but I've never met them in person. They barely know me but they still went out of their way to visit me and take care of me. My father-in-law was just as sweet. The trip here was his longest flight ever and I know, at his age, it wasn't easy.

Having five people in our tiny place for a week was quite a challenge; preparing meals for five even more so. However, traveling as a pact was really fun. Sleeping and waking up to the smile of everybody, priceless. I only know a few words in Japanese and they only know a few conversational sentences in English but somehow everything worked out well even when my husband was at work. They made our home the most joyous place to be in.

I can write forever about their stay with us but since pictures are worth a thousand words, here are the snippets:

I wasn't going to post anything about their trip because I thought it might make my parents a little sad that they were not here with me like my in-laws were. But on a second thought, this post might make them happier knowing that I am fully accepted and loved by my husband's family. My parents really wanted to be with me during this tough time but they decided that saving the money to help us would be a wiser move. I know it aches their hearts but I'm really grateful for their sacrifices.

Every night I thank God for all the blessings he has bestowed upon me. Having amazing families both in Japan and Philippines is one of the many that I received. I am also deeply blessed with the friends we have here that made us a part of their families.

 

 

My takeaway:

# Our biggest blessing will always be our families.
