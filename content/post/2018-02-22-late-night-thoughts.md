It's been a while since my last post. There are drafts, random thoughts. I'm not really sure if they make any sense, that is why I haven't had the courage to let them out. Afraid of being judged, I guess.

I get caught up in my head sometimes. I think way too much about how others see me. So much so that I end up not doing the things I really want to do, or worse, doing things just to please people. This has to stop.

The way people perceive me is something that I cannot control; hence, I should not think about it.

I should start doing things that I want without the worry of being seen as silly or shallow.
