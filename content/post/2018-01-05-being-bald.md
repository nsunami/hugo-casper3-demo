I was never afraid of going bald. I saw my mother lose all her hair during her chemo and it didn't make her less beautiful. It made her beauty radiate more.

When my oncologist told me about my diagnosis, he also told me about the side effects that come with chemotherapy. He mentioned fatigue, nausea, loss of appetite, change in taste, and hair loss. He said there are medicines he can give to prevent all the side effects except for hair loss. The look onÂ his face told me that a lot of people find hair loss the most disturbing side effect as it is the most visible one.

# Being bald isn't dreadful, the loss of control is.

Losing hair didn't bother me. I do care about how I look. I take care of my skin and apply makeup. I try my best not to look sick. There's nothing wrong with looking sick especially when you are sick. It's just that, I don't want to see the pity in other's eyes. I don't know how to confront it nowâ€”I don't know if I ever will.

Not all types of chemotherapy can cause hair loss, but the ones that do usually remove hair sometime after the 2nd infusion. They say it's the most expensive haircut one can ever get. ðŸ˜‰ I asked my husband to shave my hair just days after my first infusion. I chose to be bald before the chemo starts to take away my hair. It's my way of having a sense of control.

Cancer taught me that there are a lot of things in life you can't control. You can't control whether or not you'll have cancer, what cancer you'll have, how aggressive the disease is, and how responsive to treatment the cancer cells are but there are things you can control. You can control how you view your situation and what to do with it. You can be ahead of the game. You can decide how to handle the cards you're dealt with. You can choose toÂ fight with a smile!
