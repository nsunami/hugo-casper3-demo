# A trip to Tajima Onsen in Japan

In this summer vacation, we visited Arima-Onsen town in Japan. The town is known for its hot spring (Onsen). As we explored the town, we bumped into a small shop called [Arima Tansanriki (](https://twitter.com/tansanriki)[有馬炭酸力](https://twitter.com/tansanriki)[)](https://twitter.com/tansanriki) that specializes in carbonated drinks. Jazelle likes soda (especially Coke), so we chose to visit.

We entered the shop and suddenly noticed that they sell not only the Arima soda (Arima Cider) but also sodas from places all over Japan. There was Wasabi Soda, Kobe Beef Steak Soda, and Drian Soda, and more. The sheer variety of sodas was surprising.

# Ninja in Soda Shop?

As we were looking at many sodas, we heard a child laughing inside the shop. When I looked around, I saw a kid holding a Shuriken (a Japanese throwing weapon). Where on the earth, do we find Ninja in a soda shop? Apparently, at Tansanriki, we do. The shop has a little play area where people can rent a blow gun, a Shuriken, a pellet rifle, and a crossbow to shoot into a target. A man at the shop said that for each bullseye gets a prize.

# Jazelle and Crossbow

The game sounded fun, so one of my niece and Jazelle tried out. Jazelle chose a crossbow. She had 3 shots to go to hit the target about 5 meters away. I noticed that her look changed when she aimed the crossbow at the target. “Hey, they’re eyes of a hunter”, I told myself. Then comes the first shot—it was a little off the mark. For the second shot, the arrow launched from her crossbow and landed straight into the center as if it was drowned to it. “You hit the bullseye!”, I said, “And you still have one more shot to go!” In the last shot, she aimed at the target and pulls a trigger—_schhwaff—bang_! I couldn’t believe my eyes—she got a bullseye again twice in a row. “I’ve never seen someone hit the bullseye twice in a row!”, the man at the shop congratulated her.

I jokingly told Jazelle that I would never buy her a crossbow. :p

Now I hope that she scored the bullseye for her marriage. I may not look like a bull, but I’m glad to be her bullseye.
