The first day of the winter season is the day of the year when the Sun is farthest south. When I was diagnosed, I felt as though winter started early for me. There was a sudden freezing cold that followed me wherever I went. It marked the scariest season of my life thus far.

I love the cold but this winter really gave me the coldest, longest nights and the dimmest dawn. It was really scary and I know I wouldn't have survived it without the love of God and the warmth of all the people surrounding me. Today, it is still cold but it is not freezing anymore. I can already see and smell the blossoms of spring. My winter is almost over.
