On the day of my diagnosis, there was a news that broke my heart into pieces. It broke my heart in a way cancer could never do. It left me frozen inside. What's the news?

# You may become infertile; You may never have a child of your own.

 

I have read this chemotherapy side effect during the nights I kind of obsessed reading about lymphoma (treatments and personal stories of other warriors). I pushed the thought aside because it was too hard for me to bear. I would like to think I was successful at ignoring the possibility of infertility, for a couple of days at least. Until my oncologist told me "You may become infertile; Because of the combination of drugs, you may never have a child of your own."

There's 30-40% chance of infertility after chemotherapy.

Sixty percent chance of having my own baby in the future is not exactly what I had in my mind and in my heart. It's not totally bad, it could be worse. Then again, research state that Hodgkin's lymphoma is least common in Asia. I am from the Philippines and when I checked, our country doesn't even have a national statistics for lymphoma cases. That's how low the occurrence is. So the chance of me hitting the infertility jackpot was very real to me.

I respect people who became and who want to be parents of children that they do not have a genetic relationship with. I know there's a lot of kids out there that need love and acceptance but given the choice, I would really want to have my own.

Yesterday, we went to a fertility clinic. The doctor educated us with the available procedures for fertility preservation. The first two he discussed were egg freezing and embryo freezing. Pros of egg freezing are that I will have more freedom and control over what to do with my eggs in the future if ever my husband and I grow apart which I believe is not going to happen, and the cost is cheaper by thousands. The con of egg freezing is that it does not thaw as well as a frozen embryo. On the other hand, the pro of embryo freezing is better chances of having a live birth, 95% chance (way more than 60%, I was happy). However, here are the cons: in the event that my husband decides he doesn't want to have a baby with me I cannot use the frozen embryo because it is going to be a conjugal belonging were he has more say than I do (again, I have faith this is not going to happen). Another con is that embryo freezing is more expensive.

The other two procedures the doctor talked about are ovarian tissue freezing and GnRH agonist treatment or ovarian suppression. These two procedures are still considered experimental. According to the doctor, in the whole world, there are only around 25 babies born successfully with ovarian tissue freezing. In addition, it is not recommended for women with blood cancers such as lymphoma due to the risk of putting cancer cells back into the body with the frozen tissue ([Link](https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/physical-side-effects/fertility-and-sexual-side-effects/fertility-and-women-with-cancer/preserving-fertility-in-women.html)). The last procedure, ovarian suppression also has yet to be proven successful in improving pregnancy rates and chances of live birth.

After hearing all the options, my husband and I are set to embryo freezing. The only thing is the cost. We know no amount of money can compare to the assurance that we will have better chances of having a child of our own genetic makeup in the future but we don't have the numbers.

My husband is a graduate student. He is on an F1 visa (he is Japanese) and I am his dependent. Our visas don't allow us to work here in any way. Right now, we are living on his stipend. We have a place we call home and we are eating well every day but our budget is really tight. Sadly, our savings are going to dry out soon because of the recent turn of events in our lives.

Our families are very willing to help us financially but we're not sure if it's going to be enough to get us through this storm we are at. We need more help. I don't know exactly how we will get the help that we need but I am certain we will have some because God always provides.
