Two years ago I got married. I met my loving husband when we were in college. We were both taking BS Psychology but I didn't meet him until we were in the third year. He was a friend of my dear friend.

Tall and thin with a face that is always neat. Handsome? Sure! He's one of the most intelligent and gritty persons in our batch. I would often see him in the library with his laptop on and Psych journals to read. Kind, honest, and refined, I said to myself, there is no way that this man is straight. It's too good to be true.

Â 

# He must be gay!

(\*I love homosexuals, bi-sexuals, transgenders, and cisgender. Oh, I love rainbows and all! ðŸŒˆ)

Â 

Well, I was wrong. He was interested solely in the opposite sex. What I didn't know until months later was that he was interested in me. (\*blushing while writing)

About a month before he confessed his feelings to me, he was lending me books, offering me medicine when I wasn't feeling well, lending me an umbrella when it rained, and he was smiling more often. I really had no idea he liked me, I just thought, what a nice person.

Fast forward to almost seven years together, I still think he is one of the nicest persons I know. We were in a long distance relationship for almost 5 years before we wed. Miles and miles were between us, from the Philippines to Japan, to Illinois, and to Delaware. It was tough but I believe it made us grow as individuals and it made our relationship stronger.

There was never a day that I felt unloved or unappreciated. He had always been so loving, understanding, nurturing and encouraging. He was generous with affirmation, humor, knowledge, respect, patience, and gifts (\*even if I told him long before that I'm not into receiving gifts). He was so good at expressing how much he loves and cares for me.

Up to this day, he is all that...

# He is all that and more!

Â 

Sometimes, I ask myself...what did I do to deserve him. I am not idolizing him in any way. He is not perfect, the rest of us aren't but he is the best for me. And I thank God every single day for making our paths cross, at the perfect time and under the perfect circumstances.

Now, he is a cancer warrior as much as I am. We are only starting this journey but his sacrifices are already unimaginable! I remember the time when he first told me he loves me, he mentioned a quote he read in a book. It will never cease in my mind. The quote goes, "When I pick one side of the stick, I'm picking up the other".

He has always been true to his words. A man of honor and humility.

Â 

# My angel sent by God!

Â 

Until next time!

Lots of love,

Cancer warrior

Oh! I forgot to tell you...

# I love him truly and deeply!

(\*more than he'll ever know!)
