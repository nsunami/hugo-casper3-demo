To anyone who’s reading, hello!

Before anything else, I’d like to warn you… I’m not a good writer but that’s not the point of writing, right? (excuse! Haha) My name is Jazelle Maira. I’m a wife to a wonderful man, a daughter to my loving parents, a sister to a beautifully strong woman, a friend to very supportive few, a stranger to most, and recently I became a cancer warrior.

Cancer has been in my life before but not in the way that it is now. My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer when I was 15. She fought hard, really hard, and she won! I really admired my mother for her courage and my father for his strength during that trying time.



# Now, it is my time, my time to be courageous, to be strong.


I always knew my chances of having cancer is really high. My mother, as you now know, had breast cancer. My Lola (maternal grandmother) had the same but she lost her battle. So at 15, I was preparing myself for the possibility of having breast cancer. My mother’s oncologist told me and my sister to start our yearly mammography when we turn 35. Why 35? That’s because my mother was diagnosed when she was 45. Somehow the “rule” was to start being vigilant 10 years ahead of your mother’s age of diagnosis.

At 23, I had my first mammography. Not that I am excited nor eager to have one, I was just being cautious. I’m mean my odds are pretty high and like what they always say… “better safe than sorry”. The result of my first mammography showed that I am all clear! I didn’t have any beasts in my precious boobs. They were in great condition.

Every month, I rigorously check my boobs and axillary for lumps. I do it because it’s my OB-GYN’s advice. And I do it for my peace of mind. I have been preparing for the boob beast for a decade and a year now. It turns out…



# I was preparing for the wrong cancer.


Preparing for cancer, no matter the type is bizarre, I know. I am fully aware that nobody will ever be prepared to be told that they have a disease that will change the course of their lives and the lives of the people they love. I for sure was not ready.

On the first day of November, I had my routine checkup scheduled. Everything was going as expected. I was weighed and my height was measured (I stopped growing vertically when I was 14, they could have just asked! Haha). My vitals were checked and then the family nurse practitioner asked me how I was feeling. I told her the things I have noticed and felt for the past month.

More than 10 minutes, it took me more than 10 minutes to answer her question. It was quite a lot really but she listened patiently. She said at the end, “There’s absolutely something going on but don’t worry, I will get to the bottom of this!” She ordered a blood work, chest x-ray, and abdomen ultrasound.

I drove to the hospital for the laboratory tests right after. By 2 pm, I was done with blood work and chest x-ray. Around 4:30, I got a call. It was the nurse practitioner. She said the results of my tests are in.

According to the results, something was definitely wrong with my blood work and the x-ray showed a mass in my right chest but they were not sure what it was. No additional explanation or information was given except that I needed a chest CAT scan and that it needed to be done as soon as I can. I was very alarmed with the urgency I heard in the nurse practitioner’s voice but there was no time to process the anxiety that I felt. I called my husband immediately, and I completed the CAT scan the same day.

Two days later, the nurse practitioner called. CAT scan revealed that I have swollen lymph nodes near my heart. You might have lymphoma, she said. And then she went on saying that lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system, that it is very treatable, and so on and so forth. She emphasized that lymphoma is a very treatable cancer but I was terrified! I’m 26, “you may have cancer” is not something I ever envisioned to hear this soon.

My lab results were shared with an oncologist for an opinion. The oncologist reached out to a thoracic surgeon. A team was made for my care. Different offices called me to schedule additional tests and my biopsy was on the way. Life suddenly became so busy. Busy was good though, it meant that we were doing everything to get to the bottom of things.

There’s a lot of waiting involved before a diagnosis can be made. During the wait, my husband and I read everything we can about lymphoma. We watched videos about lymphoma and discovered a lot of people going through it. It was comforting in a way because it made us realize we are not alone.



# We accepted that I have lymphoma days before the formal diagnosis because all the tests point to it, because I have all the symptoms, and because acceptance is half the battle won.


On the 15th of November, I was diagnosed with Nodular sclerosis Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Although we still don’t know what stage I have or if the cancer has metastasized, the oncologists drilled me and my husband with all the possible treatment plans. So we went out of the clinic with a new found strength and positivity.

This journey that we never anticipated to take will have hurdles and may even have sinkholes along the way but I know we can come out of this! Stronger than before with the help of our family and friends.



# Cancer is tough and ugly but it’s not all bad.


Stay with me as I share the realizations and learnings I had and will have on this new journey.





Lots of love,

Cancer Warrior
