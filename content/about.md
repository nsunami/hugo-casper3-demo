Hi! Thanks for visiting. I started this website with the powerful encouragement of my husband. In a way it is a joint blog, he is in charge of all CSS codes while I do the content. A place where I can share my thoughts, experiences, and whatnots. Letâ€™s see where it takes!

The posts on this website will be primarily about life, love, and anything I find interesting. Photos are all by me unless otherwise stated.

Hope you enjoy!
